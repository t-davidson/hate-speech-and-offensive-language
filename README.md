Repository for Thomas Davidson, Dana Warmsley, Michael Macy, and Ingmar Weber. 2017. "Automated Hate Speech Detection and the Problem of Offensive Language." ICWSM. You can find the pre-print [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04009).

You can find our labeled data in the `data` directory. We have included them as a pickle file (Python 2.7) and as a CSV.

***Please cite our paper in any published work. We would also appreciate it if you could fill out this short [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrPNlfVBlqxun2tivzAtsZaOoPC5YYMocn-xscCgeRakLXHg/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1506871634&entry.147453066&entry.1390333885&entry.516829772) if you are interested in using our data so we can keep track of how these data are used and get in contact with researchers working on similar problems.***

You will also find a notebook in the `src` directory containing Python 2.7 code to replicate our analyses in the paper and a lexicon in the `lexicons` directory that we generated to try to more accurately classify hate speech.
